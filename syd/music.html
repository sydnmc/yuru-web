      <h2 class="centered">hi! o/</h2>
      <p class="centered">producing is something that my brain has always wanted me to do, but honestly hasn't materialized in too much so far >_<</p>
      <p class="centered">i started taking a bit seriously when i made my first music projects in 2021, taking a music technology class in high school. i'd continue with this class for a number of years, but the only thing i feel proud enough with to share publicly today is <a>shiranaieki</a>.
    before that, i had made ねむいどれみー (nemui doremy) over winter break in 2022 in 2 days, and also covered シュタロフテノラッセ (Shutarofutenorasse) by Shibayan on a whim during my first semester of university. so far, that's all i'm comfortable sharing with the world~ but i have plans to add a lot more to this... sometime soon :p</p>

        <p>first time seriously using ableton (as i had used logic pro in class for many things before), wanted to do something touhou because i was listening to a ton of shibayan at the time (things don't ever quite change hehe) and i think it turned out pretty well! would like to make an extended cut someday, and release this on spotify when i can get actual image art for it, but for now you can check it out on youtube :3</p>

        <p>only thing here that i actually finished for class and feel good enough releasing to the public ^_^ made this in a mix of logic and ableton - most of the chords and stuff i did in class with logic and other effects + beat were done with logic. pretty happy with how this turned out, so c:</p>

        <p>released <strong>Sept 10th, 2024</strong></p>
        <p>this actually came about because i had been listening to しゅがー ぱーてぃくる (sugar particle) a lot and really loved a lot of the songs on there (this one included) but i wasn't as much of a fan of the tuning... i had messed around a bit with vocaloid for other class projects i had done before, so i knew the basics before hopping in, but this really kinda was a 5 day (give or take) project to teach myself how to use vocaloid, which is pretty cool!!</p>
