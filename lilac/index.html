    <p>hi there.
      <br><br>to be perfectly honest with you, i don't really know who or what i am. but, i'm here! 
      <br>if you get along with sydney, you'll probably get along fine with me too~
      <br>i plan to populate this page with some of the gds ive done on osu, as well as some other stuff - maybe some of my own personal ramblings?
      <br>
      <br>expect this subdomain to be a lot more personal than sydney's, i don't expect too many people to be lurking here... so, welcome~
    </p>
