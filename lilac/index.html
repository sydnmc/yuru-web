      <p>hello!! if you don't know who i am, i'm <span style="color: white; font-weight: bold;">lilac</span> / <span style="color: white; font-weight: bold;">yuiyamu</span>. 
      <br><br>
        i haven't done a whole ton that i can show off like sydney, but i've <a href="gds.html" class="normal-text">mapped a few things on osu</a> and have helped with this website, and other programming projects that sydney is working on.
        if you're curious about what exactly my relation to sydney is, <a href="whoami.html" class="normal-text">click here!</a> it's a bit complicated, so it's okay to not understand too much at first if you aren't used to systems. if you aren't too interested in all the details but don't know me, then basically: if you get along with sydney, you'll probably get along fine with me too~
