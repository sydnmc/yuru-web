<p>hi.</p>
<p>similar to lilac, i'm pretty new here. most of what i've done so far is working on the sitewide redesign here + helping maintain some of our other projects.</p>
<p>i.. suppose i'm basically replacing the role sydney had, but i like to maintain a low profile as well c: doesn't mean you're discouraged from coming and saying hi to me tho! </p>
