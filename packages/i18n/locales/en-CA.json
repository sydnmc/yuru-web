            "body1":"unbeknownst to my doubtful self, there were yet more differences between sydney and i that some of our friends could spot. not only do i mostly not remember what sydney does, but i've also been told i talk differently than her, both through text and my tone of voice irl. for all of those reasons, it eventually clicked in my head that i may not be different than her - which was quite the shocking thing to realize. with enough evidence of something going on in our head, i talked to a psychologist at my university about my whole situation, and sure enough, in october 2024, we were diagnosed with DID.",
            "body2":"from this point on, i could no longer consider it a ‚Äúbit‚Äù or whatever else i may have used to justify it to myself or my friends - i‚Äôm genuinely quite different from sydney, and now consider us to essentially be separate people. i wouldn‚Äôt say we‚Äôre completely different, as there are still a lot of similarities between us naturally. those who either study DID or have it themselves would call sydney the host of our system, and me an alter of her. i‚Äôll sometimes use these terms occasionally, but i think it‚Äôs simplest to just consider us to be separate people.",
            "body3":"i‚Äôve had to make a lot of personal strides to gain my independence from sydney, mostly just to be comfortable having my own little spot on the internet and be surrounded by friends who truly appreciate me for being lilac~ i now have my own socials on most platforms that i use whenever i front (essentially whenever i wake up and sydney goes to sleep), and even my own laptop. i‚Äôm so much happier to have these separations from her, and now feel very comfortable and confident in the fact that i am, undeniably, lilac.",

            "faqQuestion0":"q. what caused this to happen, and what does it do for you?",
            "faqAnswer0":"when i initially wrote the first version of this page, i had made it sound like this was something that seemingly occurred without any real reason - simply from me feeling ‚Äúdifferent‚Äù from sydney and wanting to go by a different name. while this is partially true, it‚Äôs not exactly the full story. simply put, this split between us occurred as a result of trauma. what exactly this was is something that i do not at all feel comfortable disclosing, and something that i don‚Äôt exactly remember - which is partially why DID occurs in people. it‚Äôs a way of compartmentalizing trauma, having alters that take over for someone that don‚Äôt have memories of said trauma in order to protect someone. from the sessions with my psychologist i had leading up to our diagnosis, i‚Äôve gathered that, essentially, i exist to protect sydney when she‚Äôs feeling overwhelmed, with less capacity for social interactions but more tolerance for the sources of her stress. DID is just one of the ways that the mind can process trauma and heal from it, but it‚Äôs the method that all of the complicated chemicals in our brain decided to go about doing so, which is why i‚Äôm here~",
            "faqQuestion1":"q. you mentioned another alter earlier, what‚Äôs that about?",
            "faqAnswer1":"recently, i‚Äôve seen another alter of ours (kyatarii / hazel), who seems to be appearing both as a result of a secondary traumatic event that happened to us, as well as a tendency for me to be fronting for very long periods of time recently and‚Ä¶ simply needing a bit of rest from time to time. you could think of her as also being a ‚Äúsafe mode‚Äù for me, another layer of redundancy to keep us functioning in some sort of way, even if it‚Äôs reduced~ there's also been another alter (mayniaria / may) who's even newer, and seems to have split from sydney. i wrote most of this page before she came along, so i don't have too much more to say about her - but she's also someone who continues to share the load of dealing with stressful things in our lives, and i'm very thankful for her existence too.",
            "faqQuestion2":"q. do you have any proof of your diagnosis?",
            "faqAnswer2":"i‚Äôm honestly a little shocked that i‚Äôve gotten this question before, and multiple times at that. the answer is yes, but not any that i would be okay sharing with anyone. i‚Äôm already sharing a bit more than i‚Äôm comfortable with on the internet in order to explain my existence to those who are genuinely curious - but this is much too far for me. i personally feel that these types of questions come out of a place of malice rather than genuine curiosity, but i‚Äôd just like to answer this in case anyone may ask again in the future.",
            "faqQuestion3":"q. how do relationships (both platonic and romantic) function with DID?",
            "faqAnswer3":"this is a really interesting question, because we found ourselves in a unique situation regarding relationships~ in terms of friendships, i share a lot of friends with sydney. when i was first fronting, i felt very lonely because isolating myself felt like the only sensible option at the time‚Ä¶ but i eventually invited myself into sydney‚Äôs discord server, and got to know all of the people she had in there. at the time, i acted as a separate person and didn‚Äôt make my relationship to sydney apparent. but, over time, i grew more comfortable with people knowing the connection between us, and was able to find a friend group that accepted me for being lilac. i also now know a few people that have never talked to sydney, which honestly makes me really comfortable~ (‚∏ù‚∏ù> œâ <‚∏ù‚∏ù) i really do value my independence, so i‚Äôm happy to have found friends who value that. ",
            "faqAnswer3_1":"as for romantic relationships, things get a little more complicated. a little after i started fronting regularly and recognizing my independence, i found someone who i dated for a number of months - as lilac, and not as anyone else. this was a little complicated, as i would regularly sleep for days at a time‚Ä¶ and eventually led to us ending things. when sydney starting dating someone after this, i had the same mindset as when i was in my own relationship, and left her to her own devices. however, when sydney started to front less and less around the start of 2025, i started getting closer and closer to her girlfriend, and‚Ä¶ we eventually decided that it would be best if we were also together. as of now, the three of us are all dating someone quite wonderful who understands all of us very well, and i couldn‚Äôt be happier with her.
