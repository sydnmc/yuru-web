## localization
our system (mostly lilac) is currently working on translating every page on our site into japanese - and, thanks to the help of our lovely girlfriend, work for hebrew translations is also currently underway! however, this does not apply to sydney's pages, as those are no longer being maintained.

> english: 100% | pages are translated from english~

> japanese: every page except for `lilac/whoami` and `yurukyan/sets` (maintained by [yurukyan](https://github.com/sydnmc))

> hebrew: only `yurukyan/home` and the error page (maintained by anne)

> mandarin: also every page except for `lilac/whoami` and `yurukyan/sets` (maintained by [pearl](https://github.com/pearlwrap))

## dev notes
since this project now utilizes sveltekit as its framework, installation and development are relatively simple. just go to the root of the project, run `pnpm install` to install all of the dev dependencies, then `pnpm run dev` to start a local server.

note: because of how individual servers are run for each web page (due to turborepo), you must make sure you have ports `1414` through `1417` open before running.

despite using sveltekit, we prefer not using the built in server functionality and, instead, have a single `main.js` in `src/lib/server` which you must also run to have a local backend~ this also assumes that you have all of the necessary .json files to serve, which can be fetched from [here](https://api.yuru.ca/sets), [here](https://api.yuru.ca/gds?person=lilac), and [here](https://api.yuru.ca/gds?person=sydney).

### .env

in the server folder, there's a few enviornment variables you can configure to make the server operate however you may like. 

`LAST_FM_KEY` - key to access the last.fm api, which you can get [here](https://www.last.fm/api/account/create)

`OSU_KEY` - your personal legacy osu! api key, which can be found [here](https://osu.ppy.sh/home/account/edit#legacy-api)

`UPDATE_LAST` - the amount of gds you'd like to update with every automatic update, which by default is set to 10. older gds generally don't need to be updated ever, which is why this setting exists.

`UPDATE_EVERY` - the interval in which you'd like maps to update in hours, by default set to 12 hours.

`VALID_ACCESS_KEY` - your access token to modify the set and gd data on the server. this can be whatever you'd like, but make it secure :3

### api info

more information on the api can be found at [api.yuru.ca](https://api.yuru.ca), as it serves a page explaining all the endpoints at its root~
