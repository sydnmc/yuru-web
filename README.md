# yuru-web

my own personal website~

each folder is a different subdomain, i.e. `lilac` is [lilac.yuru.ca](https://lilac.yuru.ca), `syd` is  [syd.yuru.ca](https://syd.yuru.ca), and the main `yurukyan` folder is just [yuru.ca](https://yuru.ca). 

the `webserver` folder contains code to help with the backend, specifically allowing for automatic updates of each subdomain's gd page, as well as the ability to easily add new maps to the database as well.
 
also trying to do jp translations for each page but forgive me if im slow with them :p
