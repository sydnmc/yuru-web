# yuru-web

my own personal website~

each folder is a different subdomain, i.e. `lilac` is [lilac.yuru.ca](https://lilac.yuru.ca), `syd` is  [syd.yuru.ca](https://syd.yuru.ca), and the main `yurukyan` folder is just [yuru.ca](https://yuru.ca). 

the `website-tools` folder contains various tools to help with the website (girlie is too lazy to set up actual backend stuff teehee):
 - `gds-updater` handles osu!web api requests and can update/add additional gds to each `mapstatus.json`
 
also trying to do jp translations for each page but forgive me if im slow with them :p
