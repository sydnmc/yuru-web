# yuru-web

yurukyanâ–³ system personal website~

`syd` and `lilac` contain pages specific to our subdomains (i.e. [syd.yuru.ca](https://syd.yuru.ca) and [lilac.yuru.ca](https://lilac.yuru.ca) respectively). 

`webserver` contains the backend of the website ([api.yuru.ca](https://api.yuru.ca)). there isn't any data included (as this is updated regularly and accesses other apis for various things such as last.fm and pluralkit integration) but you can see what data is on the server through the various endpoints listed below.

`webserver/common` contains base css used across all parts of the website, as well as common pages between both lilac and sydney (such as the gds or 404 pages).
 
we're also working on japanese translations for each page - however these may take a while, so don't expect anything at too fast of a pace :3
